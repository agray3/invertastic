About
-----------------

Invertastic is a utility for performing large-scale dense SPD matrix
inversions on parallel computers. For full details, please see

A. Gray, "Invertastic: Large-scale Dense Matrix Inversion", 
submitted to Bioinformatics (2015), 
preprint available at www.archer.ac.uk/documentation/white-papers/


Options
----------------

Invertastic accepts the following arguments:

 --size <N>
 	specify size N for NxN square matrix to be inverted

[--check] 
 	if specified, the code will multiply the original matrix by
	the resulting inverse, compare this product (element-wise)
	with the expected identity matrix, and print the maximum
	deviation.


[--input <full path to input file>] 
        if specified, the code will read the input matrix from the 
	specified file. If not specified to allow performance benchmarking 
 	and testing the code will create an SPD matrix on-the-fly using
	random numbers.


[--output <full path to output file>] 
	if specified, the code will write the output matrix to the 
	specified file.


Compilation
----------------

Invertastic depends on MPI, PBLAS, BLACS, and ScaLAPACK libraries. The
Makefile is currently configured for the ARCHER UK national
supercomputing facility, using Intel MKL. To compile on ARCHER:

module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-intel
cd src
make clean
make

To configure for other machines, the Makefile should be edited to
specify the apprpriate paths.



Execution
---------------

This distribution contains a sample job script, run.sh, for running
invertastic on ARCHER using the PBS job submission system.
